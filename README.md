# SpaceX Merlin Engine - Blender 3D Model

I made this 3D Model of a SpaceX Merlin engine to eventually be 3D printed as nerdy house decor.
I designed it to be 3D printer ready but I never actually printed it so I can't guarantee what's going to come out if you actually try it.

I personally like the lower poly look it has, but eventually I'm going to add a subdivision to make it as smooth as it actually is irl.
